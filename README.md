Version 1.0

In order to familiarize myself with the Python language,
I have created a github repository with all the solutions to problems
I have completed on LeetCode. I have both Java solutions and Python
solutions stored and I will save them in separate repositories.




Problems Completed:

I will list the problems completed and the TC/SC of all


Easy:
1: Two-Sum [Easy]:
    TC: O(n^2)    SC:O(1)
    TC: O(n)      SC: O(n)
167: Two Sum II: Input Array Sorted [Easy]
    TC: O(n)     SC: O(1)
    Need to revisit: O(n log n) with potential for O(log n): binary ssearch


Medium:


Hard:
